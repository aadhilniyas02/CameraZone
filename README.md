# Camera Zone - E Commerce Website for Camera Shop
I developed a fully responsive e-commerce website for a camera shop using Laravel, PHP, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL. The project follows the MVC pattern and includes secure authentication with middleware for both customer and admin logins, along with a user-friendly customer registration page. It features product listings that allow customers to browse available items, and an admin panel that enables admins to log in, add products, delete products, and update product information. I designed comprehensive UI elements and wireframes to ensure an intuitive shopping experience, and I created a robust database schema supported by an ER diagram and a detailed database plan. The project involved thorough testing using defined test cases to ensure functionality and reliability.
